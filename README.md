# GSSF

*PyTorch implementation for TIP2024 paper of [**“GSSF: Generalized Structural Sparse Function for Deep Cross-modal Metric Learning”**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15266).*   

*It is built on top of the [SGRAF](https://github.com/Paranioar/SGRAF), [RCAR](https://github.com/Paranioar/RCAR), [DBL](https://github.com/Paranioar/DBL/) and [Awesome_Matching](https://github.com/Paranioar/Awesome_Matching_Pretraining_Transfering).*  

*If any problems, please contact me at r1228240468@gmail.com. (diaohw@mail.dlut.edu.cn is deprecated)*

Sorry for the late release. We plan to update and upload the code by the end of January!
